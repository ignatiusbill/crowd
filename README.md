# crowd

"crowd" is a game similar to "Heads Up!" by The Ellen DeGeneres. The reason why I'm working on this is I had fun playing it and was curious on what the technical challenges are.

Currently still in development. To check it out, do the steps below:

```
git clone https://github.com/ignatiusbill/crowd.git
cd crowd
npm install
```

## For Android

```
react-native run-android
```

## For iOS

```
react-native run-ios
```
