# crowd

"crowd" is a game similar to "Heads Up!" by The Ellen DeGeneres. The reason why I'm working on this is I had fun playing it and was curious on what the technical challenges are.

Currently still in development. You can check it out using Expo (download Expo app and scan the QR code found in the link below).
